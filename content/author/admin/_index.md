Hello, I'm Kevin Xu ZHONG (钟旭), currently a research associate working in [The Suttle Lab](http://www.ocgy.ubc.ca/~suttle/) at The University of British Columbia. I love studying viruses of all kinds (dsDNA, RNA, ssDNA viruses) and from different environments (lake, ocean, deepsea, sediment, etc.) and hosts (microbes, zooplankton, sea-creatures, etc.). I specialize in molecular biology and bioinformatics for omics analysis. I love to develope methods for moving forward on our understanding about viruses and microbes, and their roles in following fields: 

  * Environmental virology
  
  * Environmental microbiology
  
  * Host-associated microbiome
  
  * ...
