# Abstract.
abstract = "Microviridae is a subset of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses infecting bacteria. This group of phages has been previously observed to be very abundant (representing >90% of the total known viral metagenomic sequences) in Lake Bourget. However, this observation was made only during one period (in summer) and from a single sample collected at a single depth (near surface). This result suggests the importance of these viruses, poorly examined thus far, especially in fresh waters. In this study, performed on the two largest natural lakes in France (e.g. Lakes Annecy and Bourget), Microviridae structure was determined each month throughout the year (2011) using PCR-DGGE, with primers that target the major-capsid-protein-encoding gene VP1; cloning/sequencing was used to investigate their diversity. Our results confirm that Microviridae are diverse in peri-alpine lakes and are mainly represented by gokushoviruses. We also found for the first time ssDNA viruses belonging to Alpavirinae, another subfamily within Microviridae recently proposed by Krupovic and Forterre (2011), generally prophages infecting members of the Phylum Bacteroidetes. Our data also support highly variable community composition and dynamics of individual components whose patterns were different between lakes, suggesting distinct host communities and/or abiotic influences between the two ecosystems. We point out that most of the major observed ssDNA Microviridae viruses display boom-bust patterns (with a sharp increase/decline) in their dynamics, with high relative abundances, suggesting brutal control of hosts and rapid regulation of the host community structure."
