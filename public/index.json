A main challenge lies in reducing eukaryotic host signature when using universal 18S rRNA gene markers that capture conservative regions of eukaryotes. Various Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) manipulation in tandem with host-specific blocking primers can be used. However, blocking primers usually target within the universal primers, which could reduce the phylogenetic resolution due to such short fragment, and its application is limited to certain host range. Hence, we report a versatile method that use laboratory-designed and synthesized guiding RNA (gRNA) to guide CRISPR-cas9 to cut specifically the host 18S rDNA amplicon. As a result, the protists and fungal 18S amplicons could be enriched in the sequencing data. This method adds a promising tool to study eukaryotic microbiomes of complex system, offering a broad implication in pathogens diagnosis, symbiotic study, microbiome therapy, etc.\nApplied this method to 10 model-organisms of metazoan and plant, our results showed that up to 99% of host 18S amplicons were digested while not affecting micro-eukaryotic amplicons of protists and fungus.\nUsing this method, the eukaryotic microbiome has been sucessuflly investiaged for [oyster](), [sealice](),\nExtending this approach to other metazoan and plant, we are able to design sgRNA for each organism of SILVA database and create a sgRNA database for researchers who want to apply to their own organisms for various purposes.\nThis CRISPR work is part of \u0026ldquo;The shellfish gene\u0026rdquo; project funded by The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation during year 2017 - 2021, with aime to investigate the eukaryotic microbiome associated to pacific oysters to understand the causis of high mortality for oyster hatchy in Vancouver area. The CRISPR work lead to two R packages, and two articles publications.

Our knowledge e.g. on the interactions of viruses with the living (organisms) and non-living compartments (i.e. dissolved organic matter/particles/nutrients/physical factors) in aquatic environments has considerably increased. Furthermore, recent new ideas, concepts and technologies have shed light on host-virus interactions and the diversity of viral species and functions as discussed in this book. This chapter highlights some of these current advances in the field of aquatic viral ecology. Recently developed models and concepts will also be discussed, further emphasising the role of defence mechanisms against viruses which appear to be important drivers in strain diversification of host species. Additionally, new environments such as anoxic and benthic sediments have received more attention and novel information has been gathered e.g. on archaeal and RNA viruses. Interactions within entire food webs, such as with heterotrophic dinoflagellates, oysters and even cascading effects up to cyanobacteria-consuming flamingo populations represent another aspect of looking at viruses and their role in the global biosphere.

This group of phages has been previously observed to be very abundant (representing 90% of the total known viral metagenomic sequences) in Lake Bourget. However, this observation was made only during one period (in summer) and from a single sample collected at a single depth (near surface). This result suggests the importance of these viruses, poorly examined thus far, especially in fresh waters. In this study, performed on the two largest natural lakes in France (e.g. Lakes Annecy and Bourget), Microviridae structure was determined each month throughout the year (2011) using PCR-DGGE, with primers that target the major-capsid-protein-encoding gene VP1; cloning/sequencing was used to investigate their diversity. Our results confirm that Microviridae are diverse in peri-alpine lakes and are mainly represented by gokushoviruses. We also found for the first time ssDNA viruses belonging to Alpavirinae, another subfamily within Microviridae recently proposed by Krupovic and Forterre (2011), generally prophages infecting members of the Phylum Bacteroidetes. Our data also support highly variable community composition and dynamics of individual components whose patterns were different between lakes, suggesting distinct host communities and/or abiotic influences between the two ecosystems. We point out that most of the major observed ssDNA Microviridae viruses display boom-bust patterns (with a sharp increase/decline) in their dynamics, with high relative abundances, suggesting brutal control of hosts and rapid regulation of the host community structure.","tags":["freshwater","aquatic viruses"],"title":"Structure and diversity of ssDNA Microviridae viruses in two peri-alpine lakes (Annecy and Bourget, France)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

We therefore conducted a 1‐year survey of the surface waters of France's two largest lakes, Annecy and Bourget, which are characterized by different trophic states and phytoplanktonic communities. We found complementary and contrasting diversity of phycodnavirus in the lakes based on two genetic markers, the B family DNA polymerase‐encoding gene (polB) and the major capsid protein‐encoding gene (mcp). These two core genes have already been used, albeit separately, to infer phylogenetic relationships and genetic diversity among members of the phycodnavirus family and to determine the occurrence and diversity of these genes in natural viral communities. While polB yielded prasinovirus‐like sequences, the mcp primers yielded sequences for prasinoviruses, chloroviruses, prymnesioviruses and other groups not known from available databases. There was no significant difference in phycodnavirus populations between the two lakes when the sequences were pooled over the full year of investigation. By comparing Lakes Annecy and Bourget with data for other aquatic environments around the world, we show that these alpine lakes are clearly distinct from both other freshwater ecosystems (lakes and rivers) and marine environments, suggesting the influence of unique biogeographic factors.","tags":["algae viruses","freshwater"],"title":"Contrasting diversity of phycodnavirus signature genes in two large and deep western European lakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhong and Jacquet"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1393660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393660800,"objectID":"7e8c625fa80cad95ad5f1c795d73e5d4","permalink":"/publication/t4phage_fb_2014/","publishdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/t4phage_fb_2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Bacteriophages play an important role in plankton population dynamics and biogeochemical cycling, but their community dynamics and diversity are still poorly known, especially in fresh waters.

However, both the diversity and functional roles of these viruses in fresh waters are still poorly understood. We conducted a year-long study in 2011 of the community structure of planktonic virus groups in the upper lit layer of two important freshwater natural ecosystems in France, Lake Annecy (oligotrophic) and Lake Bourget (oligo-mesotrophic). Using PCR-DGGE to target a number of different structural and functional signature genes, i.e.,g20, g23, psbA, polB, and mcp, the phytoplankton viruses were shown to display temporal and spatial variability. There were marked seasonal changes in community structure for all viral groups in Lake Bourget, but only for T4-like myoviruses and psbA-containing cyanophages in Lake Annecy. The multivariate statistical analyses revealed that (1) various environmental factors can directly or indirectly explain the community structure observed for each phytoplankton viral group, and (2) temporal patterns of T4-like myovirus community structure were similar between the two lakes. In general, our results (1) suggest that the observed algal virus patterns were associated with significant shifts in phytoplankton biomass and/or structure, which in turn were shaped by the abiotic environment, and (2) support the Bank model proposed by Breitbart and Rohwer (Trends Microbiol 13:278–284, 2005). This study provides new evidence that freshwater lakes contain a significant diversity of algal viruses, and that the distribution of these viruses strongly mirrors that of their hosts.","tags":["algae viruses","cyanophages","virus-host interaction","freshwater"],"title":"Seasonal variations in PCR-DGGE fingerprinted viruses infecting phytoplankton in large and deep peri-alpine lakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Parvathi et al."],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1391241600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1391241600,"objectID":"3c20dcf0e05bc3ce713fc57a46f91829","permalink":"/publication/parvathi_2014_hess/","publishdate":"2014-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/parvathi_2014_hess/","section":"publication","summary":"Microbial dynamics have rarely been investigated in Lake Geneva, known as the largest lake in western Europe. From a 5-month survey, we report dynamic patterns of free-living virus, bacteria and small phytoplankton abundances in response to a variety of environmental parameters. For the first time, we fractionated the primary production to separate the contribution of different size-related biological compartments and measured both bacterial and viral production in addition to experiments conducted to quantify the virus-induced bacterial mortality. We observed marked seasonal and vertical variations in picocyanobacteria, bacteria and virus abundances and production. The contribution of picoplankton and nanoplankton production to the total primary production was high (reaching up to 76% of total primary production) in November and the spring–summer transition period, respectively. The impact of viral lysis on both bacteria and picocyanobacteria was significantly higher than grazing activities. Virus-induced picocyanobacterial mortality reached up to 66% of cell removal compared to virus induced (heterotrophic) bacterial mortality, which reached a maximum of 34% in July. Statistical analyzes revealed that temperature and top-down control by viruses are among important factors regulating the picocyanobacterial dynamics in this lake. More generally speaking, our results add to the growing evidence and accepted view nowadays that viruses are an important actor of freshwater microbial dynamics and more globally of the functioning of the microbial food webs.","tags":["virus-host interaction","viroplankton","freshwater"],"title":"Dynamics of auto- and heterotrophic picoplankton and associated viruses in Lake Geneva","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhong et al."],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1388563200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388563200,"objectID":"e0047c42239f39608cc0065de91ed68a","permalink":"/publication/viroplankton_me_2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/viroplankton_me_2014/","section":"publication","summary":"We sampled the surface waters (2–50 m) of two deep peri-alpine lakes over a 1-year period in order to examine (1) the abundance, vertical distribution, genome size, and morphology structures of the virioplankton; (2) the virus-mediated bacterial mortality; and (3) the specific genome size range of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phytoplankton viruses. Virus-like particle (VLP) concentrations varied between 4.16 × 107 (January) and 2.08 × 108 part mL−1 (May) in Lake Bourget and between 2.7 × 107 (June) and 8.39 × 107 part mL−1 (November) in Lake Annecy. Our flow cytometry analysis revealed at least three viral groups (referred to as virus-like particles 1, 2, and 3) that exhibited distinctive dynamics suggestive of different host types. Phage-induced bacterial mortality varied between 6.1 % (June) and 33.2 % (October) in Lake Bourget and between 7.4 % (June) and 52.6 % (November) in Lake Annecy, suggesting that viral lysis may be a key cause of mortality of the bacterioplankton. Virioplankton genome size ranged from 27 to 486 kb in Lake Bourget, while it reached 620 kb in Lake Annecy for which larger genome sizes were recorded. Our analysis of pulsed field gel electrophoresis bands using different PCR primers targeting both cyanophages and algal viruses showed that (1) dsDNA viruses infecting phytoplankton may range from 65 to 486 kb, and (2) both cyanophage and algal “diversity” were higher in Lake Annecy. Lakes Annecy and Bourget also differed regarding the proportions of both viral families (with the dominance of myoviruses vs. podoviruses) and infected bacterial morphotypes (short rods vs. elongated rods), in each of these lakes, respectively. Overall, our results reveal that (1) viruses displayed distinct temporal and vertical distribution, dynamics, community structure in terms of genome size and morphology, and viral activity in the two lakes; (2) the Myoviridae seemed to be the main cause of bacterial mortality in both lakes and this group seemed to be related to VLP2; and (3) phytoplankton viruses may have a broader range of genome size than previously thought. This study adds to growing evidence that viruses are diverse and play a significant role in freshwater microbial dynamics and more globally lake functioning. It highlights the importance of further considering this biological compartment for a better understanding of plankton ecology in peri-alpine lakes.","tags":["virus-host interaction","viroplankton","freshwater"],"title":"Variations in abundance, genome size, morphology, and functional role of the virioplankton in Lakes Annecy and Bourget over a 1-year period.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhong et al."],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1385884800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1385884800,"objectID":"2e8280145312f0e605ca7838e7b11de0","permalink":"/publication/cyanophage_fems_2013/","publishdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cyanophage_fems_2013/","section":"publication","summary":"We conducted a 1-year survey of the surface waters of two deep peri-alpine lakes, and investigated the abundances and community structure of picocyanobacteria and co-occurring cyanomyophages.
