      <description>Micro-eukaryotic community characterization using deep-amplicons sequencing has been a routine technique in microbiome study in examining health, discovering pathogens, and addressing ecological and evolutionary questions in field of marine biology. A main challenge lies in reducing eukaryotic host signature when using universal 18S rRNA gene markers that capture conservative regions of eukaryotes. Various Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) manipulation in tandem with host-specific blocking primers can be used. However, blocking primers usually target within the universal primers, which could reduce the phylogenetic resolution due to such short fragment, and its application is limited to certain host range.</description>

      <description>I had been in INRA UMR CARRTEL at Thonon-les-bains in France under the supervision of Dr. Stéphan Jacquet for a PhD project, which was funded by Region Rhône-Alpes. During three and half years (2010-2014), I conducted research to investigate and highlight the diversity, distribution, dynamic, and community structure of phytoplankton viruses and their functional roles in three large and deep European peri-alpine lakes: Lakes Annecy, Bourget and Geneva. This PhD work increased and enriched our knowledge in freshwater viral ecology, and was published as 2 book chapters in Viruses of Microorganisms and 11 articles in peer-reviewed journals: Frontier in Microbiology, Applied Environmental Microbiology, Environmental Microbiology, Microbial Ecology, Freshwater Biology, FEMS Microbiology Ecology, Research in Microbiology, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, etc.</description>
