      <description>This is my PhD project funded by Region Rhône-Alpes during year 2010 - 2013, working in INRA UMR CARRTEL at Thonon-les-bains in France under the supervision of Dr. Stéphan Jacquet. During three and half years, I conducted research to investigate and highlight the diversity, distribution, dynamic, and community structure of phytoplankton viruses and their functional roles in three large and deep European peri-alpine lakes: Lakes Annecy, Bourget and Geneva. This PhD work increased and enriched our knowledge in freshwater viral ecology, and was published as 2 book chapters in Viruses of Microorganisms and 11 articles in peer-reviewed journals: Frontier in Microbiology, Applied Environmental Microbiology, Environmental Microbiology, Microbial Ecology, Freshwater Biology, FEMS Microbiology Ecology, Research in Microbiology, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, etc.</description>
